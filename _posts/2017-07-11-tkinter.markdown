```python

import os
from netCDF4 import Dataset

#Works for python 3
import tkinter as tk # python3
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename # python 3

#Works for python 2
#import Tkinter as tk # python2
#from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename # python2 


#To show only the dialog without any other GUI elements
root = tk.Tk()
root.withdraw()
#We get the whole path to file
ask_filename = askopenfilename(initialdir= os.getcwd(),
filetypes =(("NetCDF file", "*.nc"),
("All Files","*.*")),title = "Choose a file.")
# If you do not specify initialdir= os.getcwd()
# The initial dir would be the same as you opened the previous time

#If you want to know name.nc
#Split it and take the second element (only)
fname = os.path.split(ask_filename)[1]

#read file
fh = Dataset(ask_filename)
#read the variable in the file
variable = fh.variables['variable_name'][:]
